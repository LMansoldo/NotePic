## Documentation Structure

Detailed use case documentation **has been created** in `.md` files located within each folder of this repository. This **modular approach** helps you:

- **Explore** how each component or feature works.
- **Understand** the app’s architecture by reviewing documentation **specific to its context**.

For example:

- Check `src/components/Button/README.md` for button interaction guidelines.

This structure ensures **contextual documentation** is always placed where it’s most relevant.
